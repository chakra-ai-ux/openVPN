## üì¶ Installation

1. **Download the script:**

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/openVPN/main/install.vpn.sh
chmod +x install.vpn.sh
Run the installer as root:
sudo ./install.vpn.sh
This will install OpenVPN, configure the firewall, disable IPv6, enable password login, and create the first client config: client1.ovpn.
üë§ Adding VPN Users

OpenVPN is configured to authenticate users via Linux system accounts. To create a new VPN user:
sudo adduser yourusername
You will be prompted to enter a password ‚Äî this will be used to connect to the VPN.
üéüÔ∏è Generating .ovpn Configs for Users

To generate a new .ovpn configuration file for a specific user:
sudo su
source ./install.vpn.sh
generate_ovpn yourusername
The config file will be saved to:
~/clients/yourusername.ovpn
üì≤ Importing .ovpn on Client Devices

You can use the generated .ovpn file on any OpenVPN-compatible client:
Windows: Use OpenVPN GUI
macOS: Use Tunnelblick
Linux: Use the command-line or NetworkManager plugin
Android: Use OpenVPN for Android
iOS: Use OpenVPN Connect
Transfer the .ovpn file securely to the device and import it via the respective app.
üõ°Ô∏è Security Tips

Always create strong passwords for system users.
Do not share .ovpn files publicly ‚Äî they contain sensitive certificates and keys.
If possible, rotate TLS and CA certificates periodically.
Keep your system and OpenVPN package up-to-date.
